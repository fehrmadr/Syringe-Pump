## Specifications of the syringe pump.

((1.25mm/rotation)/(3200 steps/rotation)) x (pi x 9.5mm^2) = 0.111mL

The resolution of the syringe pump is approximately 0.1 milliliters.

The maximum theoretical flow rate of the syringe pump is 725mm/minute.
In practice, this will be impacted by friction, as this is not a frictionless or low friction system, heat and the viscosity of the liquid.
